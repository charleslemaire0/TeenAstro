# TeenAstro WiFi Server for the SHC

This is the ESP8266/ESP32 webserver for TeenAstro
It enables the TeenAstroto SHC to be controlled over WiFi (IP). This access can be over a command channel
and/or website.
This server is known to work from personal computers (using a browser), phones and tablets,
Sky Safari, and my ASCOM driver (PC.)
