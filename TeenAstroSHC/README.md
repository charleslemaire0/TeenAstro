OnStep Smart Hand Controller
===========================

# What is a smart hand controller (SHC)?
This firmware is designed to run on a Teensy3.2 micro-controller which communicates with OnStep across the ST4 guiding port to provide
setup and control of most features.  This is largely (almost entirely at the moment) based on Charles Lemaire's excellent TeenAstro work.
While you can point to point wire/assemble you own hardware design many will opt to use the inexpensive 
EasyEDA PCB.  For those who choose a more complete DIY experience the EasyEDA schematic still can serve as wiring instructions. :)
