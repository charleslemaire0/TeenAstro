TeenAstro an easy to use telescope controller
======

Computerized telescope goto control based on Arduino driven stepper motors and OnStep.  All Equatorial mount types are supported: German Equatorial, Fork (and variations)

I was a user of the FS2 And I would like to have a FS3!

OnStep was designed, from the beginning, as a more or less general purpose system and provisions were made in the firmware to allow for use on a variety of mounts. For the TeenAstro project I follow a different approach => Less is more!

OnStep supports a wide variety of connection options. TeenAstro support much less options, it is then much easier to test.
