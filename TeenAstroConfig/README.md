===========  
François Desvallées and Lukas Zimmermann

This is a Python version of the TeenAstro configuration utility. 

It is currently tested on Linux and OSX.

To run it, first install the following modules: PySimpleGUI, PySerial, then run TAConfig from the command line: 

python3 TAConfig.py.

Select either TCP or serial communication. You can read and write the current board configuration, and save them to JSON files, which can be edited with a text editor.
