# Scope to Sky and TeenAstro

Mel Bartel’s [Scope to Sky calculator](https://www.bbastrodesigns.com/scopeToSky.html), written in Javascript with an HTML user interface, has several functions:  
- Given sky coordinates (either Right Ascension or Hour Angle, and Declination), compute a telescope’s axis positions.   
- Given a telescope’s axis positions, compute the corresponding sky coordinates.  
- For a telescope with encoders, display encoder values for a given telescope position or compute telescope position according to the encoder values.  

The configuration includes:  
- Setup site, time and date, time zone  
- equatorial and altazimuth mounts  
- Correction for precession, nutation and annual aberration  
- Correction for refraction  
- For equatorial mounts, set pier side (mount flip)  
- Conversion styles (trigonometry or matrix)  
- Tracking rates algorithms (method for computing the rates)  
- Encoder gears


## How to use it for testing TeenAstro Firmware
We generate a set of test cases (sky positions, site, time etc.), use ScopeToSky to compute axes positions for each, and use them as Goto targets for a TeenAstro. We read the stepper counts for both axes, normalize them back to degrees, and compare with the computed values.
